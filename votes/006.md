18:13 quintus         | I vote for Redmine.
18:13 datahead7777    | Redmine
18:13 xet7            | I vote for Redmine

18:14 quintus         | Oh
18:14 quintus         | This is consent I guess...
18:15 quintus         | Though I’m surprised xet7 voted in favour of it. There is no harm in voting against the majority, xet7. We don’t eat you.
18:15 quintus         | Okay, I declare Redmine to be the winner of this vote.
