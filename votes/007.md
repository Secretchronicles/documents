Vote 7

Summary (nonauthoritative)
--------------------------

The topic of translation software to use is an evergreen in heated
discussions around TSC. In this GD, we set out to resolve things once
and for all with call for votes on 2016-04-09 in the 2nd General
Discussion. However, the vote failed. Neither in the first nor in the
second try with reduced options any option was able to win. Thus, this
vote is failed as per §12 VotR.

### Call for Votes and Failure of Vote ###

The Call for Votes happened during the 2nd General Discussion in chat,
where voting was conducted and where we failed to obtain a binding
result. Here is the excerpt from the IRC logs from 2016-04-09:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
18:31 quintus      | The base set of options was in the announcement
18:32 quintus      | 1. Only accept traditional PO files
18:32 quintus      | 2. Only accept contributions through Transifex (refusing traditional PO)
18:32 quintus      | 3. Accept contributions through Transifex and via PO files
18:32 quintus      | 4. Enforce Weblate, no PO files as such
18:32 quintus      | 5. Weblate and PO files accepted
18:32 quintus      | 6. Custom solution
18:33 quintus      | I guess sauer2 is all in for option 6 :-)
18:33 datahead7777 | I'll just go with 5 then, since Transifex will not pass a vote
18:33 quintus      | Wait, before we start voting
18:33 quintus      | Is there anybody who wants to say something before voting?
18:33 datahead7777 | I'm just stating my plans )
18:33 sauer2       | I'm most likely not using it so, maybe I shouldnt
18:33 quintus      | Suggest additional voting options?
18:34 quintus      | This is not the case.
18:34 quintus      | Okay, please vote on one of the 6 options above
18:34 datahead7777 | I'll go with option 5 for my vote.
18:34 xet7         | I vote 4.
18:34 quintus      | I vote option 1
18:34 furbot       | Thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges. 
18:34 sauer2       | I vote 1, sigh
18:35 quintus      | With sydney_untangle unavailable, all everything hangs on DarkAceZ’s vote O_o
18:35 quintus      | DarkAceZ: What do you vote?
18:35 furbot       | -- Taming of the Shrew, Act V, Scene I
18:37 datahead7777 | xet7, we may have split our votes, depending on what you were seeking
18:37 quintus      | Since I am oviously not neutral, I leave it to datahead7777 to decide when to close the voting window for DarkAceZ 
18:37 DarkAceZ     | I have no idea how electronic translating goes, I shouldn't be deciding anything about it
18:37 quintus      | DarkAceZ: You abstain?
18:37 xet7         | datahead7777: Ok, then is me selecting 5 ok?
18:37 DarkAceZ     | I suppose
18:37 datahead7777 | If you are fine with that, xet7 
18:37 quintus      | ok
18:37 xet7         | yes
18:37 datahead7777 | I'm just saying that option 1 will defeat us otherwise
18:37 quintus      | xet7: So you change to vote 5?
18:38 xet7         | yes
18:38 datahead7777 | The same thing happens in US Presidential elections
18:38 quintus      | Okay, then everybody has voted. I close the voting window now.
18:39 quintus      | 2 for option 1, 2 for option 5, 1 abstained
18:39 quintus      | There is no winning option
18:39 quintus      | Wait, I need to take a look at the voting rules
18:39 quintus      | Ah, §11
18:40 quintus      | If no single option receives the most votes, a second vote is
18:40 quintus      | held with the set of options reduced to those options that re-
18:40 quintus      | ceived the most votes. The preceeding clauses are in force ac-
18:40 quintus      | cordingly.
18:40 quintus      | Okay, so we must vote again with the set of options reduced to options 1 and 5
18:40 quintus      | 1. Only accept traditional PO files
18:40 quintus      | 5. Weblate and PO files accepted
18:40 quintus      | Please give your vote now.
18:40 quintus      | I still vote option 1.
18:41 xet7         | I vote 5.
18:41 datahead7777 | option 5 would let us go either way
18:41 sauer2       | I vote 1
18:41 datahead7777 | If we don't get Weblate implemented, we can wait until it is
18:41 quintus      | DarkAceZ: You abstain again?
18:41 datahead7777 | As long as someone can pull PO files from it
18:42 DarkAceZ     | I abstain
18:42 quintus      | O_o
18:42 quintus      | I close the voting window
18:42 quintus      | Well, then, as per §12(1) VotR...
18:42 quintus      | A vote is failed if nobody participates, no single option re-
18:42 quintus      | ceives the most votes in the second vote
18:43 quintus      | We still have a 2:2 situation.
18:43 quintus      | That is, our vote **failed**.
18:43 datahead7777 | Did lambda-11235 vote?
18:43 quintus      | Result
18:43 quintus      | §12(2): A failed vote has no binding effects; the same subject
18:43 quintus      | might be voted over again.
18:43 quintus      | datahead7777: lambda is not a team member
18:43 datahead7777 | Yes, sorry
18:44 quintus      | Now this is very unfortunate. The decision could still not be made, albeit we voted...!
